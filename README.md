# Car Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing car sales performance across multiple dealerships using a public dataset from Kaggle.

The analysis focuses on comparing dealership performance, evaluating sales trends, and enabling dynamic filtering of key metrics to better understand patterns in vehicle sales.

Pivot tables and pivot charts were used to aggregate and visualize the data, while slicers were implemented to allow interactive filtering and improve dashboard usability.
